        Here is just a little bit about me, I am a full-time student at John wood community college. I am majoring in the field of Graphic design; I have always had a very strong and high passion for art. All through high school I took every art class that I could get my hands on and I got to take a Graphic design class and Graphic communications class, this is really where I found what career I wanted to do. As of now I am a part time worker at The Home Depot, but one day I hope to be creating and designing things for people weather that be personal items or things for the business.
