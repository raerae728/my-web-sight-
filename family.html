                I come from a family of six, I am one out of four children. With two older sisters and one little brother. Making our poor little brother the only boy. My two older sisters are my Half siblings even though I don’t think of them that way. I am a big family person and I say this because I couldn’t be doing what I love to day by getting my education for a field that I love and strive to be apart of. My family has pushed me to be the best I can be in school and to do the things that I love and that will benefit me in the long run.
